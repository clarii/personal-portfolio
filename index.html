              marketplace and B2B offerings, and our mobile and web consumer video

            <p>Look, I live a mile from the beach but I’ve only seen the sand like twice in the last year and I wouldn’t have it any other way. Instead I’ve participated in hackdays and rode Startup Buses and did things like help build Volly, a mobile messaging startup (acquired by Location Labs) that I joined as a co-founder after winning Startup Weekend with the Volly team in 2010.</p>
            <p>I also write on a blog super inconsistently. I had a decent series about building a user lab a few months ago, but for the most part, the writing really happens in fits and starts.</p>
