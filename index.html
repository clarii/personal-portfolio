          I’m building products for video creators and their fans as the head
          of product design at Fullscreen in Los Angeles.
        </h6>
        <p>
          I’m a founding employee who built our product, design and engineering
          teams while straight-up full-bore rocketship hockeysticking from 5 to
          255 employees and 300,000 to 3 billion video views a month. I am
          equal parts individual contributor and product executive and I manage
          the design team that builds our Creator Platform, our influencer
          marketplace and B2B offerings, and our mobile and web consumer video
          apps.

        <h3>Browsers without borders</h3>
        <h6>
          Frameless is an open-source iOS browser built for designers and
          prototypers that I released in November 2014.
        </h6>
        <p>
          So I built Frameless for myself as a way to learn Swift and as a
          really simple way to solve a very real problem I had with previewing
          prototypes on my iPhone. It was honestly a total accident that it
          made it to second on Product Hunt and got in Sidebar.io and has been
          a trending Swift project on Github for about a month now.
